1.0.0.rc0 (unreleased)
=========
This is a major release bringing lots of cleanups. And of course some big features:
* Compatibility with Rails 4.x
* A spec suite, continuously running on Travis CI
* Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite
* Fully isolated, mountable engine
* A test suite

Major Changes:

* We now use namespaced models and tables. This means you need to use
  HasVcards::CLASSNAME and add has_vcards/ in front view partials. The table
  names have changes accordingly. There is a migration available for that, so
  you can simply run 'rake has_vcards:install:migrations' to get them.

* We now use 'reference' instead of 'object as the polymorphic key. This means
  you should adapt your "has_one :vcard, as: 'object'" instances to "has_one
  :vcard, as: 'reference', class_name 'HasVcards::Vcard'". No action needed when
  you're using the 'has_vcards' helper in your models.

* The Address model has no polymorphic association anymore, use a Vcard as the
  main model.
